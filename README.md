# food-service-frontend

## Build
to build the frontend just navigate inside the repository and run ``ng build --watch --configuration development``

If you want to use this in combination with the backend, you actually need to copy the files from ``dist/food-service-frontemd/`` directly into ``dist`` and then copy the dist folder to your backend
